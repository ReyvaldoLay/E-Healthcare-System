# E-Healthcare System
The Online Consultation and Medical Subscription app is a system that will allow patients to consult doctors online regarding any concerns they may have with their health, especially in the case of an emergency where a doctor cannot be reached physically. 
This new system will provide both patients and doctors with an alternative solution for medical consultations, expanding the reach of doctors and medical professionals in the wider community. 
Problems such as late night emergencies, inability to reach hospitals or lack of medical professionals in the community will be minimised as the system will ensure that doctors and patients have equal access when seeking medical support.
